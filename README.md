# 90Factory Bootcamp

## Overview
This repository contains code developed during the 90Factory developer bootcamp. It includes both individual projects and solutions to various problems tackled during the bootcamp.

## Contents
The repository is organized into two main directories:

1. **parkinglot**
2. **problems**

### 1. Parkinglot
The `parkinglot` directory contains the code for a personal project called the "Parking Lot Settlement System." This project was developed as a full-stack application using the following technologies:
- **Backend**: Express.js
- **Frontend**: EJS (Embedded JavaScript templates)
- **Language**: JavaScript

#### Project Description
The Parking Lot Settlement System allows users to:
- Enter the site and register a vehicle number upon entry.
- Record the exit time of the vehicle.
- Calculate the parking fee based on the duration of the stay.

#### Tech Stack
- **Express.js**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **EJS**: A simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
- **JavaScript**: The programming language used for both frontend and backend development.
